Why I design is a difficult question. Once I realized that design is everywhere, that it rules the world in a sense, I knew I wanted to be apart of that. I’m also a jack of all trades type, so if something grabs my interest I want to know how to do it/make it. The combination of these two things are the reason I am a designer.


I design with the following quote in mind:
**“Be different, do different things,
 Don't do it like he did, cause he ain't what you is.”**
*— Kendrick Lamar*
